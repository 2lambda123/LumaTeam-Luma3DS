# Luma3DS-H
*Noob-proof Hidden (N)3DS "Custom Firmware"*

## What it is

**Luma3DS-H** is a fork of [**Luma3DS**](https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS) that aims to be as hidden as possible

**Luma3DS-H** does not allow access to Rosalina, the configuration menu and the chainloader making it hidden from plain view.
For now **Luma3DS-H** still uses the config file so its advised to remove it before using this.

[**boot9strap-hidden**](https://github.com/T3CHNOLOG1C/boot9strap-hidde) is suggested when using **Luma3DS-H**
